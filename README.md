## Introduction
<p>First off we really appreciate everyone's willingness to pitch in.  I know flying around looking for treasures and doing weekly fetch quests isn't everyone's favorite activity.  Based on beta logs, we should have everything covered that people will need to craft pre raid opening and in the first couple weeks of raid.  It may be that you only have 1-2 crafts needed for the raid team, and you may have multiple crafts a day.  We've tried to balance need with anticpated demand like doubling up on short blades and long blades for blacksmithing.  As sims come out and progress, we will update as needed.</p>

<p>Our main gating factor to having crafts covered are the weekly timegated knowledge points, along with the new resource artisan's acuity, which is replacing artisan's mettle from dragonflight.  For our purposes we will be spending acuity on recipes for the most part, either with Lyrendal in Dornegal, or one of the vendors in the City of Threads</p>

<p>Please always feel free to reach out to me on discord @urbanminer if you have any questions.  If you've never done any crafting before and don't know how to find trainers, what knowledge points are, etc, please reach out and I'll walk you through the initial set up via screenshare.</p>

## Sources of Knowledge Points
1. Renown: 10pt
2. Lyrendal: 30pt (45 points for gatherers)
3. Knowledge treasures: 24pt
4. City of threads: 10pt
5. Weekly work orders: 6pt
6. Weekly world drops: 2pt
7. Weekly rare gathers: 2pt
8. Weekly treatise: 1pt

#### Renown
Depending on the faction, at either 12 or 14 renown, you can buy a 10 knowledge point book from the renown quartermaster for 50 acuity.
- Council of Dornegal - 12 Renown - Alchemy, Blacksmithing, Enchanting, Tailoring
- The Assembly of the Deeps - 12 Renown - Mining, Engineering, Inscription
- Hallowfell Arathi - 14 Renown - Jewelcrafting, Herbalism, Skinning, Leatherworking

#### Lyrendal
Vendor in Dornegal who will sell you three different items that give 10 knowledge each (15 for gathering) that cost an increasing amount of acuity.  If you don't need your acuity for recipes, you should be able to purchase the first and second books.

#### Knowledge Treasures
Each profession has two knowledge treasures per zone for a total of 8 treasures that give 3 knowledge each.  Wowhead or another site will have a guide you can plug into tom tom or another waypoint add on to fly around and find them.  Of note, getting knowledge this way does not give you any acuity.  If there is no guide on launch, this youtube channel has videos for every profession's knowledge treasures: https://www.youtube.com/@Goldzen_tv/videos

#### City of Threads
In the bazaar there are profession trainers and vendors just like in Dornegal.  However these vendors sell a one time 10 point skill for acuity and kej, a new currency specific to the zone.  You should be able to grind the 1500 kej necessary for this item easily in the first two weeks.

#### Weekly Work Orders
The weekly crafting order quests from dragonflight have been replaced by patron (NPC) crafting orders.  They will give a wide variety of crafting orders that award mats, acuity and knowledge.  Currently on beta you can earn up to six knowledge points per week this way.  As soon as you are able you should start working on these patron orders, as they cycle every few days.

#### Weekly World and Weekly Rare Gathers
As you level you'll see each zone has it's own unique generic treasure type that are the new dirt and expedition pack from dragonflight.  Between farming these and killing rares, you should be able to get 4 knowledge points per week.

#### Weekly Treatise
Inscription can make a soulbound item called treatises that can give you one knowledge point per week.  You should post a public crafting order for two thousand gold for each of your professions each of the first two weeks to get these knowledge points.  The guild will provide this gold if you need it.

#### Summary
You should be able to get around 80 knowledge points the first two weeks assuming you can reach the necessary renown, you farm all treasures, and you're able to buy the city of threads item and 2 of 3 knowledge items from Lyrendal.  The following guides for where to put points assume you have 80 to spend which wont always be the case if your acuity is needed to buy recipes instead of points.

## Per Raider Cheat Sheet

#### Kat
Leatherworking - Tools
1. Flawless Fortes, full wheel
2. Epic Ensembles, full wheel
3. (Optional) Learned Leatherworker 20/30, pick Commanding Concentration sub wheel

Enchanting - Nerubian Cloaks
1. Everlasting Enchantments, full wheel
2. Nerubian Novelties, full wheel
3. Tertiary Trivialities, full wheel

Note: Target recipe is the cloak enchant Chant of Winged Grace which is learned from the severed threads pact.  Recommend you prioritize farming rep in Azj-Kahet for the three members of the pact.  The avoidance and leech bracer enchants are available from vendors in the city of threads but we likely wont have the acuity to purchase them right away, speed is learned from the knowledge wheel.  The lesser bracer enchants are taught by the enchanting trainer.

Jewelcarfting - Stat Gems
1. Gemcutting, full wheel
2. Sapphire, Ruby, Onyx and Emerald, 5 points in each to get to the +3 blasphemite skill cutting node
3. Continue Sapphire, Ruby, Onyx and Emerald wheels, your choice

Note: The three blasphemite recipes we care about all drop from "The War Within Dungeons".  We will likely want to spend your initial two/three weeks of acuity on JC knowledge.

#### Genesis
Alchemy - Flasks
1. Fantastic Flasks, full wheel
2. Profession Phials, full wheel
3. Bulk Production, full wheel

Note: Target flask is currently Flask of Alchemical Chaos based on logs, it takes four herbs so experiment with whatever you have.

#### Latte
Inscription - Darkmoon Sigils
1. Archival Additions, full wheel
2. Cryptic Collection, full wheel
3. Learn all sub specializations to learn to craft all sigils and pool knowledge until we know which sigils to focus on

Note: Darkmoon cards now drop and cannot be crafted.  Additionally, a deck can be now turned into an embellishment instead of a trinket through sigil crafting.  We want to focus on having a dedicated sigil crafter that can turn any deck into an embellishment to start as logs and sims come out and we find out which decks, if any, are being used as embellishments.  https://www.wowhead.com/news/revisiting-the-new-darkmoon-deck-trinkets-in-the-war-within-how-to-obtain-cards-345061

#### Dom
Leatherworking - Generic Leather Spark Gear
1. Get as much knowledge as you can for the first two weeks but don't spend it.  We're anticipating the need for some leather spark gear of some kind but don't know yet.

Alchemy - Potion Cauldron
1. Potent Potions, full wheel
2. Learn sub specialization Bulk Production but do not put any points into it
3. Alechmical Mastery, full wheel
4. Arathor's Spear wheel as far as you can get

Notes: All the herb specific sub wheels of Alchemical Mastery contribute to the potion cauldron skill.  It is unlikely we will be able to craft three star cauldrons off the bat so don't stress.  Work on those herb wheels as you can, and then finish Bulk Production.  In the war within, potion cauldrons allow users to choose potions from among recipes the cauldron crafter knows.  You'll want to get started as soon as possible with the daily cooldown, and experiment with Arathor's Spear, as that will let you discover the two potential potions we want to use, Tempered Potion and Potion of Unwavering Focus.  The guild will provide the gold for the crystal cauldron which is available from several vendors.

Jewelcrafting - Elemental Focusing Lens Embellishment
1. Shaping, full wheel
2. Glasswork, full wheel
3. (Optional) Masonry, full wheel

Note: This is the embellishment virtually everyone is using on raid testing logs.  That may just be because it's the easiest to get crafted on gear but until we have more detailed sims we can't be sure what will be used.  It may be a mix across classes but it is likely there will be a demand for this embellishment.

#### Brit/Zen
Enchanting - Nerubian Cursed Ring Enchantments

Note: The chest enchantments have been broken out into four separate enchantments instead of just a stat enchant like in dragonflight.  The int one is learned from the knowledge wheel, the healer enchant is purchased with acuity from Auditor Balwurz in Dornegal, the strength one is learned from the weekly event Awakening the machine and the agility one is learned from the weekly event The Theatre Troupe.  You'll want to make sure you get your rep up and hit 80 the first week so you have two shots at the recipes from the weekly event.

Inscription - Vantus Runes
1. Archival Additions, full wheel
2. Runic Research, 20/30

1. From Dawn Till Dusk, full wheel
2. Duskweave Tailoring, full wheel
3. Quality Fabric, 10/30
4. Spellthread, 10/30

Note: This will give us the most skill points towards the spellthreads unlocked by duskweave tailoring to let us craft it for raiders. however it is not ideal for crafting the gear unlocked in those wheels.  If you're wanting to stick with tailoring as a guild crafter, let's plan beyond the first 80 points, there is potentially very good gear unlocked in the duskweave wheels that people may want, and you'll want to go into the final wheel on duskweave to be able to craft the bolts more efficiently.

Alchemy - Flasks
1. Fantastic Flasks, full wheel
2. Profession Phials, full wheel
3. Bulk Production, full wheel

Note: Target flask is currently Flask of Alchemical Chaos based on logs, it takes four herbs so experiment with whatever you have.
